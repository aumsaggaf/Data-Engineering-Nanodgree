# Data Warehouse

This is the third project in **Data Engineer Nanodgree** with Udacity. The project focuses on building an ETL pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift using what have been learnt through the second chapter.

To complete the project, a star schema need to be defined using one fact table and number of dimension tables. In addition, data need to be loaded from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL statements that create the analytics tables from these staging tables.

## Context

Sparkify, a startup, wants to model its data that they have collected on songs and user activity on the new music streaming app. The startup has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. The data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

## Datasets

### Song Dataset

This dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. All JSON files are in subdirectories under /data/song_data. An example of what the file looks like:

```json
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

### Log Dataset

This dataset is generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the previous dataset. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations. All JSON files are in subdirectories under /data/log_data. An example of what the file looks like:

```json
{"artist":"Survivor","auth":"Logged In","firstName":"Jayden","gender":"M","itemInSession":0,"lastName":"Fox","length":245.36771,"level":"free","location":"New Orleans-Metairie, LA","method":"PUT","page":"NextSong","registration":1541033612796.0,"sessionId":100,"song":"Eye Of The Tiger","status":200,"ts":1541110994796,"userAgent":"\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/36.0.1985.143 Safari\/537.36\"","userId":"101"}
```

## Schema

A star schema is used optimized for queries on song play analysis using the song and log datasets. This includes the following tables:

### Fact Table
* ***songplays*** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong 
    * songplay_id - int PRIMARY KEY
    * start_time - date REFERENCES time (start_time)
    * user_id - int REFERENCES users (user_id)
    * level - text
    * song_id - text REFERENCES songs (song_id)
    * artist_id - text REFERENCES artists (artist_id)
    * session_id - int
    * location - text
    * user_agent - text

### Dimension Tables
* ***users*** - users in the app
    * user_id - int PRIMARY KEY
    * first_name - text
    * last_name - text
    * gender - text
    * level - text


* ***artists*** - artists in music database
    * artist_id - text PRIMARY KEY
    * name - text
    * location - text
    * latitude - float
    * longitude - float


* ***songs*** - songs in music database
    * song_id - text PRIMARY KEY
    * title - text
    * artist_id - text REFERENCES artists (artist_id)
    * year - int
    * duration - float


* ***time*** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
    * start_time - date PRIMARY KEY
    * hour - int
    * day - int
    * week - int
    * month - int
    * year - int
    * weekday - int

The database schema is shown below:

## Project Files

In addition to the data files, the project includes six files:
* `sql_queries.py` - contains all the sql queries (drop, create, insert, and select).
* `create_tables.py` - drops and creates your tables. To reset the tables, run this file specially before running the ETL scripts.
* `etl.py` - reads and processes files from song_data and log_data, loads into staging tables on Redshift, and then process that data into the analytics tables on Redshift.
* `Redshift_Cluster_Test.ipynb` - create the redshift cluster and test it.
* `README.md` (this file) - provides discussion on the project.

## Project Steps
Below are steps that can be followed to complete the project:

### Create Tables

Test by running create_tables.py and checking the table schemas in your redshift database.

* Design schemas for the fact and dimension tables
* Write CREATE statements in `sql_queries.py` to create each table if it does not exist.
* Complete the logic in create_tables.py to connect to the database and create these tables
* Write DROP statements in `sql_queries.py` to drop each table if it exists.
* Launch a redshift cluster and create an IAM role that has read access to S3.
* Add redshift database and IAM role info to dwh.cfg.
* Test by running `create_tables.py` and checking the table schemas in your redshift database.

# Build ETL Pipeline
* Implement the logic in `etl.py` to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift.
* Implement the logic in `etl.py` to load data from staging tables to analytics tables on Redshift.
* Test by running `etl.py` after running `create_tables.py` and running the analytic queries on the Redshift database to compare the results with the expected results.
* (To avoid extra charges) Delete your redshift cluster when finished.

### Document Process
Do the following steps in your README.md file:
* Discuss the purpose of this database in the context of the startup, Sparkify, and their analytical goals.
* State and justify your database schema design and ETL pipeline.

[Optional] Provide example queries and results for song play analysis.

## Run Project
To see the results of the project, there are few steps that must be followed:
1. Run ``` Redshift_Cluster_Test.ipynb ``` until **STEP 4**.
2. In a terminal, run ``` pyhton create_tables.py ```.
3. In a terminal, run ``` pyhton etl.py ```.
4. Run **STEP 5** in ``` Redshift_Cluster_Test.ipynb ``` to see the numbers of each table.
5. Run **STEP 6** in ``` Redshift_Cluster_Test.ipynb ``` to clean up the resources.
