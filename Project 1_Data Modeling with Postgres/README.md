# Data Modeling with Postgres

This is the first project in **Data Engineering Nanodgree** with Udacity. The project focuses on two concepts that have been learnt through the first two lessons in the first chapter, which are:

* Data modeling with Postgres
* Build an ETL pipeline using Python

To complete the project, a star schema need to be defined using one fact table and number of dimension tables. In addition, write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files into the tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.

## Context

Sparkify, a startup, wants to model its data that they have collected on songs and user activity on the new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, the analytics team don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON metadata. They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis.

## Datasets

### Song Dataset

This dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. All JSON files are in subdirectories under /data/song_data. An example of what the file looks like:

```json
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

### Log Dataset

This dataset is generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the previous dataset. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations. All JSON files are in subdirectories under /data/log_data. An example of what the file looks like:

```json
{"artist":"Survivor","auth":"Logged In","firstName":"Jayden","gender":"M","itemInSession":0,"lastName":"Fox","length":245.36771,"level":"free","location":"New Orleans-Metairie, LA","method":"PUT","page":"NextSong","registration":1541033612796.0,"sessionId":100,"song":"Eye Of The Tiger","status":200,"ts":1541110994796,"userAgent":"\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/36.0.1985.143 Safari\/537.36\"","userId":"101"}
```

## Schema

A star schema is used optimized for queries on song play analysis using the song and log datasets. This includes the following tables:

### Fact Table
* ***songplays*** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong 
    * songplay_id - int PRIMARY KEY
    * start_time - date REFERENCES time (start_time)
    * user_id - int REFERENCES users (user_id)
    * level - text
    * song_id - text REFERENCES songs (song_id)
    * artist_id - text REFERENCES artists (artist_id)
    * session_id - int
    * location - text
    * user_agent - text

### Dimension Tables
* ***users*** - users in the app
    * user_id - int PRIMARY KEY
    * first_name - text
    * last_name - text
    * gender - text
    * level - text


* ***artists*** - artists in music database
    * artist_id - text PRIMARY KEY
    * name - text
    * location - text
    * latitude - float
    * longitude - float


* ***songs*** - songs in music database
    * song_id - text PRIMARY KEY
    * title - text
    * artist_id - text REFERENCES artists (artist_id)
    * year - int
    * duration - float


* ***time*** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
    * start_time - date PRIMARY KEY
    * hour - int
    * day - int
    * week - int
    * month - int
    * year - int
    * weekday - int

The database schema is shown below:

## Project Files

In addition to the data files, the project includes six files:
* `sql_queries.py` - contains all the sql queries (drop, create, insert, and select).
* `create_tables.py` - drops and creates your tables. To reset the tables, run this file specially before running the ETL scripts.
* `etl.ipynb` - reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into the tables. This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables. It helps to write the next file (`etl.py`).
* `etl.py` - reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into the tables.
* `test.ipynb` - displays the first few rows of each table to check the database.
* `README.md` (this file) - provides discussion on the project.

## Project Steps
Below are steps that can be followed to complete the project:

### Create Tables
* Write CREATE statements in `sql_queries.py` to create each table if it does not exist.
* Write DROP statements in `sql_queries.py` to drop each table if it exists.
* Run `create_tables.py` in the terminal to create the database and tables.
* Run `test.ipynb` to confirm the creation of the tables with the correct columns.

### Build ETL Processes
* Follow instructions in the `etl.ipynb` notebook to develop ETL processes for each table.
* At the end of each table section or at the end of the notebook, run `test.ipynb` to confirm that records were successfully inserted into each table.

### Build ETL Pipeline
* Use `etl.ipynb` to complete `etl.py`, where the entire datasets will be processed.
* Run `test.ipynb` to confirm your records were successfully inserted into each table.

### Document Process
Do the following steps in your README.md file:
* Discuss the purpose of this database in the context of the startup, Sparkify, and their analytical goals.
* State and justify your database schema design and ETL pipeline.

[Optional] Provide example queries and results for song play analysis.

## Run Project
To see the results of the project, there are few steps that must be followed:
1. In a terminal, run ``` pyhton create_tables.py ```.
2. In a terminal, run ``` pyhton etl.py ```.
3. Run `test.ipynb` to see few of the records in each table.
4. Restart this notebook to close the connection to the database. Otherwise, you won't be able to run your code in `create_tables.py`, `etl.py`, or `etl.ipynb` files since you can't make multiple connections to the same database (in this case, sparkifydb).
