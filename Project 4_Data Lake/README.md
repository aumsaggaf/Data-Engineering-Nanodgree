# Data Warehouse

This is the fourth project in **Data Engineer Nanodgree** with Udacity. The project focuses on Spark and data lakes to build an ETL pipeline for a data lake hosted on S3 using what have been learnt through the thrid chapter.

To complete the project, a star schema need to be defined using one fact table and number of dimension tables. In addition, data need to be loaded from S3, processed into analytics tables using Spark, and loaded back into S3.

## Context

Sparkify, a startup, wants to model its data that they have collected on songs and user activity on the new music streaming app. The startup has grown their user base and song database and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. The data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app. The analytics team will provide the queries and compare the results with their expected results. Then the analytics team will continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

## Datasets

### Song Dataset

This dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. All JSON files are in subdirectories under /data/song_data. An example of what the file looks like:

```json
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

### Log Dataset

This dataset is generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the previous dataset. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations. All JSON files are in subdirectories under /data/log_data. An example of what the file looks like:

```json
{"artist":"Survivor","auth":"Logged In","firstName":"Jayden","gender":"M","itemInSession":0,"lastName":"Fox","length":245.36771,"level":"free","location":"New Orleans-Metairie, LA","method":"PUT","page":"NextSong","registration":1541033612796.0,"sessionId":100,"song":"Eye Of The Tiger","status":200,"ts":1541110994796,"userAgent":"\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/36.0.1985.143 Safari\/537.36\"","userId":"101"}
```

## Schema

A star schema is used optimized for queries on song play analysis using the song and log datasets. This includes the following tables:

### Fact Table
* ***songplays*** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong 
    * songplay_id - int PRIMARY KEY
    * start_time - date REFERENCES time (start_time)
    * user_id - int REFERENCES users (user_id)
    * level - text
    * song_id - text REFERENCES songs (song_id)
    * artist_id - text REFERENCES artists (artist_id)
    * session_id - int
    * location - text
    * user_agent - text

### Dimension Tables
* ***users*** - users in the app
    * user_id - int PRIMARY KEY
    * first_name - text
    * last_name - text
    * gender - text
    * level - text


* ***artists*** - artists in music database
    * artist_id - text PRIMARY KEY
    * name - text
    * location - text
    * latitude - float
    * longitude - float


* ***songs*** - songs in music database
    * song_id - text PRIMARY KEY
    * title - text
    * artist_id - text REFERENCES artists (artist_id)
    * year - int
    * duration - float


* ***time*** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
    * start_time - date PRIMARY KEY
    * hour - int
    * day - int
    * week - int
    * month - int
    * year - int
    * weekday - int

The database schema is shown below:

## Project Files

In addition to the data files, the project includes six files:
* `dl.cfg` - contains your AWS credentials
* `etl.py` - reads files from song_data and log_data in S3, rocesses that data using Spark, and writes them back to S3.
* `test.ipynb` - testing the functions and commands separately.
* `README.md` (this file) - provides discussion on the project.

## Project Steps
Below are steps that can be followed to complete the project:

* First, AWS credentials should be inserted in `dl.cfg`.

### Build ETL Pipeline
* Implement the logic in `etl.py` to load data from S3 as json files.
* Use spark to process the files and generate the tables.
* Load the tables back to S3.
* (To avoid extra charges) Delete your S3 bucket when finished.

### Document Process
Do the following steps in your README.md file:
* Discuss the purpose of this database in the context of the startup, Sparkify, and their analytical goals.
* State and justify your database schema design and ETL pipeline.

[Optional] Provide example queries and results for song play analysis.

## Run Project
To see the results of the project, there are few steps that must be followed:
1. In a terminal, run ``` pyhton etl.py ```.
It might take about 5-10 minutes in total to finish.
